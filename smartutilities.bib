@article{Almirall2014,
abstract = {The management of many health disorders often entails a sequential, individualized approach whereby treatment is adapted and readapted over time in response to the specific needs and evolving status of the individual. Adaptive interventions provide one way to operationalize the strategies (e.g., continue, augment, switch, step-down) leading to individualized sequences of treatment. Often, a wide variety of critical questions must be answered when developing a high-quality adaptive intervention. Yet, there is often insufficient empirical evidence or theoretical basis to address these questions. The Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART)-a type of research design-was developed explicitly for the purpose of building optimal adaptive interventions by providing answers to such questions. Despite increasing popularity, SMARTs remain relatively new to intervention scientists. This manuscript provides an introduction to adaptive interventions and SMARTs. We discuss SMART design considerations, including common primary and secondary aims. For illustration, we discuss the development of an adaptive intervention for optimizing weight loss among adult individuals who are overweight.},

abstract = {The assessment of the benefits and risks associated with a medicine's use requires careful consideration of a wealth of information of varying format and quality, ranging from efficacy and safety data derived from randomized clinical trials to statistical results from health outcomes studies to spontaneously reported adverse events. Contrary to the expectations of patients, physicians, and regulators, the literature offers little guidance as to how to strike an appropriate balance between benefit and risk. Although a qualitative listing of a medicine's benefits and risks is useful, much could be gained from a systematic and transparent process to evaluate a medicine's pre- and postmarketing performance. The authors propose a representational model based on multicriteria decision analysis that can incorporate both evaluative judgments from different perspectives (e.g., physician, patient) and quantitative data to inform tradeoffs between multiple benefit and multiple risk elements in a logically consistent and transparent manner. The model is designed to highlight the relative merits and deficits of treatment alternatives in well-defined and specific contexts. It is intended to serve as a common platform to facilitate focused benefit-risk tradeoff discussions between scientists, physicians, regulatory authorities, and pharmaceutical companies, and to assist in the communication of clear and consistent messages regarding those tradeoffs.},

abstract = {The quality of life of patients is an important component of evaluation of therapies. We present an overview of a sta- tistical method called Q-TWiST (Quality-Adjusted Time Without Symptoms and Toxicity) which incorporates quality-of-life considerations into treatment comparisons. Multivariate censored survival data are used to partition the overall survival time into periods of time spent in a set of progressive clinical health states which may differ in qual- ity of life. Mean health state durations, restricted to the follow-up limits of the clinical trial, are derived from the data and combined with value weights to estimate quality- adjusted survival. The methodology emphasizes treatment comparisons based on threshold utility analyses that high- light trade-offs between different health state durations; it is not intended to provide a unique result combining qual- ity and quantity of life. We also describe three recent ex- tensions of the methodology: covariates can be included using proportional hazards and accelerated failure time regression models, restricted estimates can be projected beyond follow-up limits using parametric models, and meta-analyses can be performed incorporating quality-of- life dimensions. The basic methods are demonstrated in an analysis of data from a clinical trial comparing long versus short duration adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of breast cancer. The clinical health states are defined by the following three outcomes: (1) end of treatment toxicity, (2) disease recurrence, and (3) death. The results allow one to evaluate the trade-off between the increased toxic effects and the increased recurrence-free interval associated with the long duration treatmen},

abstract = {Randomization is firmly established as a cornerstone of clinical trial methodology. Yet, the ethics of randomization continues to generate controversy. The default, and most efficient, allocation scheme randomizes patients equally (1:1) across all arms of study. However, many randomized trials are using outcome-adaptive allocation schemes, which dynamically adjust the allocation ratio in favor of the better performing treatment arm. Advocates of outcome-adaptive allocation contend that it better accommodates clinical equipoise and promotes informed consent, since such trials limit patient-subject exposure to sub-optimal care. In this essay, we argue that this purported ethical advantage of outcome-adaptive allocation does not stand up to careful scrutiny in the setting of two-armed studies and/or early-phase research.},

In the treatment of metastatic melanoma, combinations of checkpoint inhibitors are more effective than single agent inhibitors, but combination immunotherapy is associated with increased frequency and severity of toxicity. There are questions about the use of combination immunotherapy or single agent anti-PD-1 as initial therapy and the number of doses of either approach required to sustain a response. In this paper, we describe a novel use of sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design to evaluate immune checkpoint inhibitors to find treatment regimens that adapt within individual based on intermediate response and lead to the longest overall survival. We provide a hypothetical example SMART design for BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma as a framework for investigating immunotherapy treatment regimens. We compare implementing a SMART design to implementing multiple traditional randomized clinical trials. We illustrate the benefits of a SMART over traditional trial designs and acknowledge the complexity of a SMART. SMART designs may be an optimal way to find treatment strategies that yield durable response, longer survival, and lower toxicity.},

Altering the intensity and type of intervention over time is crucial for many reasons, such as to obtain improvement if the individual is not responding or to reduce costs and burden when intensive treatment is no longer necessary. Adaptive interventions utilize individual variables (severity, preferences) to adapt the intervention and then dynamically utilize individual outcomes (response to treatment, adherence) to readapt the intervention. The Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) provides high-quality data that can be used to construct adaptive interventions. We review the SMART and highlight its advantages in constructing and revising adaptive interventions as compared to alternative experimental designs. Selected examples of SMART studies are described and compared. A data analysis method is provided and illustrated using data from the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone SMART study.},

Sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trials (SMARTs) are multi-stage trial designs that yield data specifically for building effective DTRs. Modeling the marginal mean trajectories of a repeated-measures outcome arising from a SMART presents challenges, because traditional longitudinal models used for randomized clinical trials do not take into account the unique design features of SMART. We discuss modeling considerations for various forms of SMART designs, emphasizing the importance of considering the timing of repeated measures in relation to the treatment stages in a SMART. For illustration, we use data from three SMART case studies with increasing level of complexity, in autism, child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and adult alcoholism. In all three SMARTs, we illustrate how to accommodate the design features along with the timing of the repeated measures when comparing DTRs based on mean trajectories of the repeated-measures outcome.

abstract = {A design is presented for a randomized clinical trial comparing two second-line treatments, chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus reirradiation, for treatment of recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer. The central research question is whether the potential efficacy benefit that adding reirradiation to chemotherapy may provide justifies its potential for increasing the risk of toxicity. The design uses two co-primary outcomes: time to disease progression or death, and time to severe toxicity. Because patients may be given an active third-line treatment at disease progression that confounds second-line treatment effects on toxicity and survival following disease progression, for the purpose of this comparative study follow-up ends at disease progression or death. In contrast, follow-up for disease progression or death continues after severe toxicity, so these are semi-competing risks. A conditionally conjugate Bayesian model that is robust to misspecification is formulated using piecewise exponential distributions. A numerical utility function is elicited from the physicians that characterizes desirabilities of the possible co-primary outcome realizations. A comparative test based on posterior mean utilities is proposed. A simulation study is presented to evaluate test performance for a variety of treatment differences, and a sensitivity assessment to the elicited utility function is performed. General guidelines are given for constructing a design in similar settings, and a computer program for simulation and trial conduct is provided.},

abstract = {A design is proposed for randomized comparative trials with ordinal outcomes and  prognostic subgroups. The design accounts for patient heterogeneity by allowing possibly different comparative conclusions within subgroups. The comparative testing criterion is based on utilities for the levels of the ordinal outcome and a Bayesian probability model. Designs based on two alternative models that include treatment-subgroup interactions are considered, the proportional odds model and a non-proportional odds model with a hierarchical prior that shrinks toward the proportional odds model. A third design that assumes homogeneity and ignores possible treatment-subgroup interactions also is considered. The three approaches are applied to construct group sequential designs for a trial of nutritional prehabilitation versus standard of care for esophageal cancer patients undergoing chemoradiation and surgery, including both untreated patients and salvage patients whose disease has recurred following previous therapy. A simulation study is presented that compares the three designs, including evaluation of within-subgroup type I and II error probabilities under a variety of scenarios including different combinations of treatment-subgroup interactions.},

abstract = {Increasing interest in individualizing and adapting intervention services over time has led to the development of adaptive interventions. Adaptive interventions operationalize the individualization of a sequence of intervention options over time via the use of decision rules that input participant information and output intervention recommendations. We introduce Q-learning, which is a generalization of regression analysis to settings in which a sequence of decisions regarding intervention options or services are made. The use of Q is to indicate that this method is used to assess the relative quality of the intervention options. In particular, we use Q-learning with linear regression to estimate the optimal (i.e., most effective) sequence of decision rules. We illustrate how Q-learning can be used with data from sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART; Murphy, 2005) to inform the construction of a more deeply tailored sequence of decision rules than those embedded in the SMART design. We also discuss the advantages of Q- learning compared to other data analysis approaches. Finally, we use the Adaptive Interventions for Children with ADHD SMART study (Center for Children and Families, SUNY at Buffalo, William E. Pelham as PI) for illustration.},

abstract = {In recent years, research in the area of intervention development has been shifting from the traditional fixed-intervention approach to adaptive interventions, which allow greater individualization and adaptation of intervention options (i.e., intervention type and/or dosage) over time. Adaptive interventions are operationalized via a sequence of decision rules that specify how intervention options should be adapted to an individual's characteristics and changing needs, with the general aim to optimize the long-term effectiveness of the intervention. Here, we review adaptive interventions, discussing the potential contribution of this concept to research in the behavioral and social sciences. We then propose the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART), an experimental design useful for addressing research questions that inform the construction of high-quality adaptive interventions. To clarify the SMART approach and its advantages, we compare SMART with other experimental approaches. We also provide methods for analyzing data from SMART to address primary research questions that inform the construction of a high-quality adaptive intervention.},

abstract = {Cluster-level dynamic treatment regimens can be used to guide sequential, intervention or treatment decision-making at the cluster level in order to improve outcomes at the individual or patient-level. In a cluster-level DTR, the intervention or treatment is potentially adapted and re-adapted over time based on changes in the cluster that could be impacted by prior intervention, including based on aggregate measures of the individuals or patients that comprise it. Cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) can be used to answer multiple open questions preventing scientists from developing high-quality cluster-level DTRs. In a cluster-randomized SMART, sequential randomizations occur at the cluster level and outcomes are at the individual level. This manuscript makes two contributions to the design and analysis of cluster-randomized SMARTs: First, a weighted least squares regression approach is proposed for comparing the mean of a patient-level outcome between the cluster-level DTRs embedded in a SMART. The regression approach facilitates the use of baseline covariates which is often critical in the analysis of cluster-level trials. Second, sample size calculators are derived for two common cluster-randomized SMART designs for use when the primary aim is a between-DTR comparison of the mean of a continuous patient-level outcome. The methods are motivated by the Adaptive Implementation of Effective Programs Trial, which is, to our knowledge, the first-ever cluster-randomized SMART in psychiatry.},

abstract = {Background There is growing agreement that regulators performing benefit-risk evaluations should take patients' and caregivers' preferences into consideration. The Patient-Focused Drug Development Initiative at the US Food and Drug Administration offers patients and caregivers an enhanced opportunity to contribute to regulatory processes by offering direct testimonials. This process may be advanced by providing scientific evidence regarding treatment preferences through engagement of a broad community of patients and caregivers. Objective In this article, we demonstrate a community-engaged approach to measure caregiver preferences for potential benefits and risks of emerging therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Methods An advocacy oversight team led the community-engaged study. Caregivers' treatment preferences were measured by using best-worst scaling (BWS). Six relevant and understandable attributes describing potential benefits and risks of emerging DMD therapies were identified through engagement with advocates (n = 5), clinicians (n = 9), drug developers from pharmaceutical companies and academic centers (n = 11), and other stakeholders (n = 5). The attributes, each defined across 3 levels, included muscle function, life span, knowledge about the drug, nausea, risk of bleeds, and risk of arrhythmia. Cognitive interviewing with caregivers (n = 7) was used to refine terminology and assess acceptability of the BWS instrument. The study was implemented through an online survey of DMD caregivers, who were recruited in the United States through an advocacy group and snowball sampling. Caregivers were presented with 18 treatment profiles, identified via a main-effect orthogonal experimental design, in which the dependent variable was the respondents' judgment as to the best and worst feature in each profile. Preference weights were estimated by calculating the relative number of times a feature was chosen as best and as worst, which were then used to estimate relative attribute importance. Results A total of 119 DMD caregivers completed the BWS instrument; they were predominately biological mothers (67.2{\%}), married (89.9{\%}), and white (91.6{\%}). Treatment effect on muscle function was the most important among experimental attributes (28.7{\%}), followed by risk of heart arrhythmia (22.4{\%}) and risk of bleeding (21.2{\%}). Having additional postapproval data was relatively the least important attribute (2.3{\%}). Conclusions We present a model process for advocacy organizations aiming to promote patient-centered drug development. The community-engaged approach was successfully used to develop and implement a survey to measure caregiver preferences. Caregivers were willing to accept a serious risk when balanced with a noncurative treatment, even absent improvement in life span. These preferences should inform the Food and Drug Administration's benefit-risk assessment of emerging DMD therapies. This study highlights the synergistic integration of traditional advocacy methods and scientific approach to quantify benefit-risk preferences. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Purpose: The Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease and Toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis method is frequently applied to evaluating outcomes in cancer clinical trials, but there is little information on what constitutes a clinically important difference (CID). We reviewed the Q-TWiST, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and utility measurement literature to develop recommendations for CID for the Q-TWiST. We also provide recommendations for measuring health utilities and for the design of Q-TWiST studies. Methods: The English language literature was searched between 1986 and 2003 for Q-TWiST studies in oncology. We estimated the percent differences between treatments based on median follow-up duration for overall, progression-free and quality-adjusted survival. We also reviewed the relevant HRQL and utility literature on clinical importance. Results: The overall differences between treatments for most (56{\%}) of the observed, published values for Q-TWiST analyses ranged between 12{\%} and 19{\%}. Three-fourths of the Q-TWiST studies had gains in survival of 12{\%}–17{\%}, while differences in progression-free survival ranged from 12{\%} to 26{\%}. Studies that have evaluated the clinical importance of changes in HRQL scores suggest that changes of 5{\%}–10{\%} are clinically meaningful, and other research suggests that 0.5 standard deviation is a reasonable threshold for changes in HRQL for chronic diseases. Similarly, one guideline from the health state utility literature is that a 5{\%}–10{\%} difference in standard gamble utility scores is clinically important. Various sources are available for health utilities for Q-TWiST studies and the most valid are derived from patients or the general public, although most studies rely on sensitivity analyses with no collection of utilities. Conclusions: We recommend that the CID for Q-TWiST is 10{\%} of overall survival in a study, and differences of 15{\%} are clearly clinically important. If less is known about a specific treatment and/or disease area, the CID should be greater than 5{\%} but not more than 10{\%} in planning sample size and statistical power. These CID estimates should be interpreted with caution, pending confirmation in future studies by direct patient assessment of the clinically relevant health states for Q-TWiST.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To finalise and validate a disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure: the ANCA-associated vasculitis patient-reported outcome (AAV-PRO) questionnaire. Using a 35-item candidate questionnaire developed following 50 qualitative interviews in the UK, USA and Canada, a longitudinal survey was conducted to determine the final scale structure and validate the AAV-PRO. METHODS Participants were recruited via Vasculitis UK and the Vasculitis Patient-Powered Research Network. The 35-item candidate questionnaire was completed at baseline and 3 months; UK participants completed the EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L), while US participants completed a test-retest exercise, 3-5 days after baseline. Scale structure was defined using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Rasch analysis. Convergent and known groups validity, test-retest reliability and longitudinal construct validity were assessed. RESULTS There were 626 participants with AAV; {\textgreater}25{\%} reporting 'active disease'. EFA and Rasch analysis supported a 29-item profile measure comprising six domains: 'organ-specific symptoms', 'systemic symptoms', 'treatment side effects', 'social and emotional impact', 'concerns about the future' and 'physical function'. Mean domain scores were higher for participants with 'active disease' versus 'remission' (p{\textless}0.001). Construct validity was demonstrated by correlations between domain scores and the EQ-5D-5L (range r=-0.55 to 0.78), all p{\textless}0.0001. In participants reporting 'no change' (n=97) during the test-retest, intraclass correlation coefficient values were high (range 0.89-0.96) for each domain. CONCLUSIONS The AAV-PRO, a new disease-specific PRO measure for AAV, has good face and construct validity, is reliable, feasible and discriminates among disease states.},

The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) vasculitis working group has been at the forefront of outcome development in the field and has achieved OMERACT endorsement of a core set of outcomes for AAV. Patients with AAV report as important some manifestations of disease not routinely collected through physician- completed outcome tools; and they rate common manifestations differently from investigators. The core set includes the domain of patient-reported outcomes (PRO). However, PRO currently used in clinical trials of AAV do not fully characterize patients' perspectives on their burden of disease. The OMERACT vasculitis working group is addressing the unmet needs for PRO in AAV. Methods. Current activities of the working group include (1) evaluating the feasibility and construct validity of instruments within the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) to record components of the disease experience among patients with AAV; (2) creating a disease-specific PRO measure for AAV; and (3) applying The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health to examine the scope of outcome measures used in AAV. Results. The working group has developed a comprehensive research strategy, organized an investigative team, included patient research partners, obtained peer-reviewed funding, and is using a considerable research infrastructure to complete these interrelated projects to develop evidence-based validated outcome instruments that meet the OMERACT filter of truth, discrimination, and feasibility.

abstract = {Major regulatory agencies, for example, FDA and EMA, have started to request comprehensive benefit-risk analyses of pharmaceutical products prior to approval or labelling expansion. The purpose of this study is to develop a generally applicable and reliable data-driven benefit-risk assessment method, where two or more drugs/doses can be compared. Our aim is to formulate an approach that is simple to apply, allows direct comparison of different types of risks and benefits, and is tailored for application in different disease areas both during clinical development and in the marketing approval phase. The proposed benefit-risk assessment method involves eight successive steps: (1) establishment of the decision context, (2) identification of benefit and risk criteria, (3) weighting, (4) scoring, (5) evaluation of uncertainty, (6) calculation of weighted scores, (7) visualization, and (8) discussion and formulation of an overall conclusion. To reduce the impact of subjective judgements, scores are assigned to each criterion on the basis of objective information (data) wherever possible. The proposed benefit-risk evaluation approach offers comprehensive, data-driven assessments that can facilitate decision processes. It employs descriptive statistical methods to highlight the clinically significant differences between drugs in clinical trials. The approach can be used in single as well as in multiple trials and provides clear diagrams as the basis for presentation and discussion of the results.},

Results—We demonstrate the increase in power over traditional single stage designs, and indicate how the power changes as a function of the weight given to each stage. Conclusion—The snSMART design is promising in a rare diseases setting where several alternative treatments are under consideration and small sample sizes are necessary.},

abstract = {A sequentially outcome-adaptive Bayesian design is proposed for choosing the dose of an experimental therapy based on elicited utilities of a bivariate ordinal (toxicity, efficacy) outcome. Subject to posterior acceptability criteria to control the risk of severe toxicity and exclude unpromising doses, patients are randomized adaptively among the doses having posterior mean utilities near the maximum. The utility increment used to define near-optimality is non-increasing with sample size. The adaptive randomization uses each dose's posterior probability of a set of good outcomes, defined by a lower utility cut-off. Saturated parametric models are assumed for the marginal dose-toxicity and dose-efficacy distributions, allowing the possible requirement of monotonicity in dose, and a copula is used to obtain a joint distribution. Prior means are computed by simulation using elicited outcome probabilities, and prior variances are calibrated to control prior effective sample size and obtain a design with good operating characteristics. The method is illustrated by a phase I/II trial of radiation therapy for children with brain stem gliomas. Keywords},

@article{Gran2009,
abstract = {For many diseases, therapy involves multiple stages, with the treatment in each stage chosen adaptively based on the patient's current disease status and history of previous treatments and clinical outcomes. Physicians routinely use such multi-stage treatment strategies, also called dynamic treatment regimes or treatment policies. We present a Bayesian framework for a clinical trial comparing two-stage strategies based on the time to overall failure, defined as either second disease worsening or discontinuation of therapy. Each patient is randomized among a set of treatments at enrollment, and if disease worsening occurs the patient is then re-randomized among a set of treatments excluding the treatment received initially. The goal is to select the two-stage strategy having the largest average overall failure time. A parametric model is formulated to account for non-constant failure time hazards, regression of the second failure time on the patient's first worsening time, and the complications that the failure time in either stage may be interval censored and there may be a delay between first worsening and the start of the second stage of therapy. Four different criteria, two Bayesian and two frequentist, for selecting a best strategy are considered. The methods are applied to a trial comparing two-stage strategies for treating metastatic renal cancer, and a simulation study in the context of this trial is presented. Advantages and disadvantages of this design compared to standard methods are discussed.},

abstract = {Generalized estimating equations (GEE (Biometrika 1986; 73(1):13-22) is a general statistical method to fit marginal models for correlated or clustered responses, and it uses a robust sandwich estimator to estimate the variance-covariance matrix of the regression coefficient estimates. While this sandwich estimator is robust to the misspecification of the correlation structure of the responses, its finite sample performance deteriorates as the number of clusters or observations per cluster decreases. To address this limitation, Pan (Biometrika 2001; 88(3):901-906) and Mancl and DeRouen (Biometrics 2001; 57(1):126-134) investigated two modifications to the original sandwich variance estimator. Motivated by the ideas underlying these two modifications, we propose a novel robust variance estimator that combines the strengths of these estimators. Our theoretical and numerical results show that the proposed estimator attains better efficiency and achieves better finite sample performance compared with existing estimators. In particular, when the sample size or cluster size is small, our proposed estimator exhibits lower bias and the resulting confidence intervals for GEE estimates achieve better coverage rates performance. We illustrate the proposed method using data from a dental study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is substantial uncertainty regarding the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar disorders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Traditional randomized controlled trials and statistical methods are not designed to discover if, when, and to whom an intervention should be applied; thus, other methodological approaches are needed that allow for the practice of personalized, evidence-based medicine with patients with bipolar depression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Dynamic treatment regimes operationalize clinical decision-making as a sequence of decision rules, one per stage of clinical intervention, that map patient information to a recommended treatment. Using data from the acute depression randomized care (RAD) pathway of the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study, we estimate an optimal dynamic treatment regime via Q-learning.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The estimated optimal treatment regime presents some evidence that patients in the RAD pathway of STEP-BD who experienced a (hypo)manic episode before the depressive episode may do better to forgo adding an antidepressant to a mandatory mood stabilizer.},
